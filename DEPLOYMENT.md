# 🚀 Deployment Documentation for Numberverse

This document outlines the deployment process and considerations for deploying the **Numberverse** React application.

---

## 📦 Build the Project

Before deploying, you need to create a production build of the project.

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized production-ready version of the application inside the `build/` directory.

## 🛠️ Deployment 

 **GitHub Pages**

**Steps:**

1. Install the GitHub Pages package:
   ```bash
   npm install gh-pages --save-dev
   ```

2. Add the following to your `package.json`:

```json
"homepage": "https://<your-username>.github.io/numberverse",
"scripts": {
  "predeploy": "npm run build",
  "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
}
```

3. Deploy the site:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

## 🌐 Environment Considerations

- **API Usage:** This app fetches data from [NumbersAPI](http://numbersapi.com) without any authentication.
- **HTTPS:** Use a secure HTTPS environment to avoid browser warnings.
- **Routing:** This app uses `react-router-dom`. Make sure your host supports client-side routing or configure redirects appropriately.
